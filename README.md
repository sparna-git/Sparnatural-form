# Sparnatural-form

A simpler, facet-like, user-oriented search UI component, that generates SPARQL queries based on a [Sparnatural](https://github.com/sparna-git/Sparnatural) configuration. The [available search widgets](https://docs.sparnatural.eu/widgets.html) are the same as in Sparnatural (dropdown lists, autocompletion search, tree, map, booleans, date, search etc.)
